=======================

Overview
--------

Welcome to the WMX ROS2 documentation. This project provides ROS2 packages
for controlling 6-DOF robotic manipulators through the WMX3 motion control
platform over EtherCAT. The current supported robot is the **Dobot CR3A**.

**Key capabilities:**

- Follow the :doc:`getting_started` guide to set up your environment and get running.
- Browse the :doc:`packages/packages` for ``wmx_ros2_message`` and ``wmx_ros2_package`` details.
- Explore :doc:`integration/integration` for MoveIt2 and Isaac cuMotion planning.
- Review the :doc:`architecture/architecture` for system design and communication flow.
- Compare :doc:`performance/performance` benchmarks across platforms.
- Check the :doc:`api_reference/api_reference` for ROS2 services, topics, and actions.
- See :doc:`examples/examples` for real-world application demos.
- Reference :doc:`deployment/deployment` for source build, Debian, and Docker options.
- Scan through :doc:`troubleshooting/troubleshooting` for answers to common issues.
